Code for Project 5: Job Advertisement Portal

P5. Job Advertisement Portal
A responsive and modern web portal is required to streamline the process of creating and
managing additional work opportunities. The primary goal of the portal is to enable
individuals to post and engage with work offers efficiently and securely. Verified users will
be able to advertise their services or post job requirements, such as "Person X offers house
cleaning for a budget of Y." Once an employer accepts an offer and the contractor agrees,
both parties can establish direct communication.

The portal will display all job offers on the main page, ensuring they are accessible to all
users. Key features include location filtering to ensure relevance (e.g., users in the US will
not see offers from the UK), a robust verification process for users to ensure trust and data
security, and secure payment integration that supports multiple options such as cash and
bank transfers.
Additionally, the website must adhere to current SEO standards, ensuring high visibility and
traffic efficiency. Data security and privacy are paramount, with secure handling of user
information and transaction details. The design and architecture of the platform must allow
for scalability and future enhancements, enabling seamless user experiences while
maintaining the integrity of the system. This solution will empower individuals to efficiently
connect with potential employers or contractors, promoting secure and localized
transactions in a user-friendly environment.
